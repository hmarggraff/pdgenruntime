<BODY>
<P>The api is used to connect ReportsAnywhere to java beans and to embed it in other applications.</P>

<P><a name="Exceptions">ReportsAnywheres</a> api may throw errors and exceptions, that must be caught. These are the
	<a href="JoriaException.html">JoriaException</a>, the
	<a href="JoriaExternalError.html">JoriaExternalError</a> and
	the <a href="JoriaInternalError.html">JoriaInternalError</a></P>

<P>The JoriaExceptions are mostly JoriaUserDataExceptions, or JoriaDataExceptions. These mean, that data for the template
	was not accessible. You need to check the message in order to find out why.</P>

<P>Errors are thrown when the data is accessible, but an unexpected condition occurs. The JoriaExternalErrors have a
	reason that is the employee
	of the person implementing/integrating or configuring ReportsAnywhere.
	JoriaInternalErrors are bugs. If they occur please send them to support@pdgen.org. In interactive mode ReportsAnywhere
	offers
	a dialog that does this for you. Please do not hesitate to use it.</P>
